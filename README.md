Objective:
This solution streamlines the backup process for the Accounts Payable team working in law firms. It is designed to efficiently handle tasks related to managing invoices, creating folders, and organizing receipts.

Use Case:
The solution is specifically tailored for the backup process and can be instrumental for law firms dealing with accounts payable. It simplifies the workflow for handling invoices, automating repetitive tasks.

Requirements:
The solution is designed to work with a folder structure named "Billing Cycle," which contains seven subfolders. Each subfolder represents a specific billing category, denoted by an amount number (e.g., $75 or $100). Within each subfolder, there are numerous PDF files, each representing an invoice for the organization.

The user's task involves:

Opening each invoice.
Extracting the invoice number.
Creating a folder using the invoice number.
Moving the invoice to the corresponding folder.
Extracting costs/disbursements from the invoices.
Searching for and collecting receipts related to the costs.
Dropping the receipts into the same invoice folder.
Functionality:
The implemented code automates the extraction of invoice numbers, creation of folders, and the process of moving invoices to their respective folders. Furthermore, it extracts costs from the databases and locates receipts for the associated costs. The entire process is streamlined into a few clicks, reducing a two-week task to approximately 10% of the original effort.

Benefits:

Efficiency: The solution significantly reduces the time and effort required for the accounts payable team's tasks.
Accuracy: Automation minimizes the likelihood of manual errors during the extraction and organization process.
User-Friendly: With just a few clicks, the majority of the two-week task is completed, enhancing overall productivity.
This solution aims to enhance the workflow of the Accounts Payable team, providing a more efficient and accurate approach to handling invoices and associated documentation in law firms.
